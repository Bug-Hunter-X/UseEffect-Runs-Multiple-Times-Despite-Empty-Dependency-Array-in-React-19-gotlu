# React 19 useEffect Bug: Unexpected Multiple Runs

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in React 19 where a `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array runs more times than expected.  This often happens due to unexpected re-renders triggered by state changes in parent components or other unforeseen circumstances.

## Bug Description
The `useEffect` hook, even with an empty dependency array (`[]`), is called multiple times after the initial render. This leads to performance issues and unexpected side effects. The issue is more prominent in complex applications with intricate component interactions.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully examining the component tree to identify the source of unnecessary re-renders. In this case, there are no direct causes within the component itself.  This might point to issues in a parent component or data fetching mechanisms.  Careful analysis using React DevTools can pin-point the root cause and help optimize the application for performance and avoid excessive `useEffect` calls.
